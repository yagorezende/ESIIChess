# ESII - Chess

This project was born as a college work in a Software Engineering class.

In order to run the game, you only have to click on the exe file according to your OS. The main menu is quite intuitive, and there are also some commands on the right pannel you see during the game. A basic minimax was used as the AI algorithm, it dives until depth 2 (0 is the root, 1 is AI's turn, 2 is player's response). The AI and the referee (status checking, move checking and rules in general) do not use any external packages. The game was developed in Python using PyGame.

Enjoy!
