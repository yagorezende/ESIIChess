# ESII - Chess

This project was born as a college work in a Software Engineering class.

In order to run the game, you only have to click on the exe file according to your OS. Download [here](https://github.com/yagorezende/ESIIChess/releases/tag/v-1.0.0-LTS).

The main menu is quite intuitive, and there are also some commands on the right pannel you see during the game. By the end of a match, a message is shown, and you can click on the screen to make it transparent, or press ENTER to return to menu.

A basic minimax was used as the AI algorithm. It dives until depth 2 (0 is the root, 1 is AI's turn, 2 is player's response). The AI and the referee (status checking, move checking and rules in general) do not use any external packages. The game was developed in Python using PyGame.

Enjoy!
